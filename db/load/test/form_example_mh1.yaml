:completion: "* Do NOT record any medical history relating to (indication under investigation)
  on this page."
:note: |
  * This is a mandatory module that must appear in ALL CRFs except for extension trials where subject's medical history was collected in previous trial.
  * Text in parentheses "(Except xxxx)" can be customized with the disease of interest (eg, Crohn's Disease) when additional indication-specific medical history modules are used or it can be deleted if not needed.
  * For EDC studies, include 3 pages (in same DCI) and if team feels an additional page (ie, a ._ _ page) is needed, it should be added to the Annex.
  * For paper studies, only include 1 page within Visit 1.  The ._ _ page should be included in the Annex, but the visit in the header should be Visit 1.
  * For OC RDC studies, terms are entered directly into the DMODIFY field and MHTERM is not used.  The OC and SAS annotations have the MHTERM highlighted to reflect this status.
  * Hepatic Event Supplemental Medical History (MHDILI1_01) will be used for DILI CRFs only.
  * The Medical History Update module (MHU1_01) is a mandatory module for extension studies (and should only be used in extension studies) and is intended to capture conditions that were not captured during the course of the prior/lead-in study.  It is NOT intended to collect NEW conditions that initially occurred AFTER the screening visit of the prior/lead-in study.  New conditions that occurred AFTER the screening visit of the prior/lead-in study should be recorded as adverse events, not as medical history.  (Note: The "Related to" column can be removed if not needed.)
