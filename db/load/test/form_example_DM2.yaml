  * This is a mandatory module that must appear in ALL CRFs.
  * CRF Number should be deleted for EDC trials.  This field should only be used for internal UCB paper studies.
  * Ethnic subgroup section can be deleted when not required as per protocol.  If used, the list of races / countries must be customized as per protocol (for internal UCB studies: new codes will need to be created).
  * For extension studies, Race, Ethnicity and Ethnic subgroup should be deleted.
  * Based on a decision made in the 31Oct12 DARC meeting, the Date of Birth field was split into three (3) separate fields: birth day, birth month and birth year.  This split is not represented in the modules within this document.  Depending upon country regulations, acceptable data collections are:
      * Full birth date = birth day, birth month and birth year
      * Partial birth date = birth month and birth year
      * Birth year only
  * Most NIS studies will use version DM3_01.
