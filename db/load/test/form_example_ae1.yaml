:note: "* This is a mandatory module that must appear in ALL CRFs (Phase I - IV).\n*
  Crohn's studies will probably need to use one of the versions created by the RA
  PSCM team.\n* Versions noted as Phase I include time of onset and time of outcome
  and can be used in any study (any phase) that needs to use time of onset and time
  of outcome.\n* __KAE1 and KAE2 are to be used for Korean KFDA-mandated Post-Marketing
  Surveillance (PMS) studies only.__\n* For OC RDC studies, terms are entered directly
  into the DMODIFY field and AETERM is not used.  The OC and SAS annotations have
  the AETERM highlighted to reflect this status.\n* Based on a DARC decision in April
  2014, a new field of \"Adverse Event of Special Interest\" was added to the Lupus
  related versions.  It was decided within that meeting that this was an exception
  and applicability to studies not within the Lupus indication was not approved at
  that time.\n* __Module ADE1_01__:  At the time of initial approval (2014-11-14),
  a PSCM team dedicated for device studies did not exist.  Therefore, this module
  was reviewed and approved by the DARC.  Due to the specific applicability for this
  module, it was determined that in spite of DARC approval this module should not
  be declared a CCM.  Hence, it was given the PSCM designation of \"DEV\" with the
  hope that in the future a PSCM for devices may be created.\n* __Module ADE1_01__:
  \ At the time of initial approval (2014-11-14), this module was slated for use in
  PD0028.  This study did not include IMP and was a device only trial.  In this case,
  the field of \"Action Taken with Study Medication\" was unnecessary and subsequently
  hardcoded to \"Not applicable\".  However, if future trial designs include a device
  that delivers IMP, then the fields \"Action Taken with Study Medication\" and \"Action
  Taken with Device\" could be the same action and therefore result in duplicate data.
  \ It is suggested that study teams consider this and whether the \"Action Taken
  with Device\" field should be removed or hardcoded. \n* Toxicity Grade: When the
  Toxicity Grade field is used, the Intensity field should be removed.  According
  to SDTM, they should not be used simultaneously in a study.\n* Pathogen: The Pathogen
  field can be added to any version of the AE page as needed per study.\n* Worksheet
  to Determine Diagnosis of Anaphylactic Reactions: This worksheet was approved by
  the DARC since no PSCM was available for ITP at the time the worksheet was created."

      * Where there is uncertainty about the relationship, take the conservative approach and classify the event as related.
      * **Related:** There is a strong relationship. For example, the AE:
          * follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study medication or in which the study medication has been established in body fluids or tissues;
          * follows a known or expected response pattern to the study medication;
          * is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the study medication (dechallenge), and reappearance on repeated exposure (rechallenge).
      * **Not related:** No study medication was taken or when the subject is taking single-blind placebo, or when the AE can be ascribed with reasonable certainty to another cause. For example:
          * the AE is a known adverse drug reaction of a concomitant medication;
          * the same AE does not appear after re-administration of the study medication (rechallenge);
          * other factors such as underlying disease, concomitant disease(s) or concomitant medication(s) are plausible to have contributed to the event.
