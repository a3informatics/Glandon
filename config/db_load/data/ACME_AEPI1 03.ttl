The OC and SAS annotations have the AETERM highlighted to reflect this status.\n* Based on a DARC decision in April 2014, a new field of \"Adverse Event of Special Interest\" was added to the Lupus related versions.  It was decided within that meeting that this was an exception and applicability to studies not within the Lupus indication was not approved at that time.\n* __Module ADE1_01__:  At the time of initial approval (2014-11-14), a PSCM team dedicated for device studies did not exist.  Therefore, this module was reviewed and approved by the DARC.  Due to the specific applicability for this module, it was determined that in spite of DARC approval this module should not be declared a CCM.  Hence, it was given the PSCM designation of \"DEV\" with the hope that in the future a PSCM for devices may be created.\n* __Module ADE1_01__:  At the time of initial approval (2014-11-14), this module was slated for use in PD0028.  This study did not include IMP and was a device only trial.  In this case, the field of \"Action Taken with Study Medication\" was unnecessary and subsequently hardcoded to \"Not applicable\".  However, if future trial designs include a device that delivers IMP, then the fields \"Action Taken with Study Medication\" and \"Action Taken with Device\" could be the same action and therefore result in duplicate data.  It is suggested that study teams consider this and whether the \"Action Taken with Device\" field should be removed or hardcoded. \n* Toxicity Grade: When the Toxicity Grade field is used, the Intensity field should be removed.  According to SDTM, they should not be used simultaneously in a study.\n* Pathogen: The Pathogen field can be added to any version of the AE page as needed per study.\n* Worksheet to Determine Diagnosis of Anaphylactic Reactions: This worksheet was approved by the DARC since no PSCM was available for ITP at the time the worksheet was created." .
