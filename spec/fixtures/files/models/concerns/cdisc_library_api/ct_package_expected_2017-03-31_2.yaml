  :submissionValue: FRM
  :definition: The form of the completed pharmaceutical product, e.g. tablet, capsule,
    injection, elixir, suppository. Dosage form can have a significant effect on the
    onset, duration and intensity of the pharmacological action of a drug. A pharmaceutical
    dosage form controls the rate at which the drug is released into the biological
    fluids. This release rate affects its intrinsic absorption pattern and therefore,
    the bioavailability of the drug.

    :definition: A unit for measuring catalytic (e.g. enzymatic) activity, the ability

      pathway between the reactants and the products. One katal is that catalytic
      activity which will raise the rate of reaction by one mole per second in a specified
      assay system. When the katal is used, the measurand should be specified by reference
      to the measurement procedure; the measurement procedure must identify the indicator
      reaction. The katal is not used to express a rate of reaction itself, which
      should be expressed in moles per second.(NCI)
