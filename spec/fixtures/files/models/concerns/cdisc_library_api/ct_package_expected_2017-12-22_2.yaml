    :submissionValue: BIO-AVAILABILITY
    :definition: A study of the degree to which or rate at which a drug or other substance
      is absorbed or becomes available at the site of physiological activity after
      administration. (NCI)

  - :conceptId: C49665
    :submissionValue: BIO-EQUIVALENCE
    :definition: A study most often used to compare the efficacy of different formulations
      to treat a given disease. It is the testing of an old versus a new formulation
      in healthy volunteers or subjects with the disease under study and usually in

    :submissionValue: PHARMACOECONOMIC
    :definition: A study that assesses the value associated with a given drug in therapeutic
      and economic terms. This type of study is multidisciplinary in nature and takes
      into consideration the social and economic costs (resource utilization costs
      including direct, indirect, and intangible costs) of drug therapy in addition
      to its direct therapeutic benefits. Analyses relate the difference in therapeutic
      benefits to the difference in costs between treatment alternatives. (NCI)
