          TRTP is a record-level identifier that represents the planned treatment attributed to a record for analysis purposes. TRTP indicates how treatment varies by record within a subject and enables analysis of crossover and other designs. Though there is no requirement that TRTP will correspond to the TRTxxP as defined by the record’s value of APERIOD, if populated, TRTP must match at least one value of the character planned treatment variables in ADSL (e.g., TRTxxP, TRTSEQP, TRxxPGy).

          As noted previously, at least one treatment variable is required even in non-randomized trials. This requirement is satisfied by any subject-level or record-level treatment variables (e.g., TRTxxP, TRTP, TRTA). Even if not used for analysis, any ADSL treatment variable may be included in the BDS dataset.

        :notes: The analysis visit description; required if an analysis is done by
          nominal, assigned or analysis visit. AVISIT may contain the visit names
          as observed (i.e., from SDTM VISIT), derived visit names, time window names,
          conceptual descriptions (such as Average, Endpoint, etc.), or a combination
          of any of these. AVISIT is a derived field and does not have to map to VISIT
          from the SDTM. AVISIT represents the analysis visit of the record, but it
          does not mean that the record was analyzed. There are often multiple records
          for the same subject and parameter that have the same value of AVISIT. ANLzzFL
          and other variables may be needed to identify the records selected for any
          given analysis. See Section 3.3.8 for information about flag variables.
          AVISIT should be unique for a given analysis visit window. In the event
          that a record does not fall within any predefined analysis timepoint window,
          AVISIT can be populated in any way that the producer chooses to indicate
          this fact (i.e., blank or “Not Windowed”). The way that AVISIT is calculated,
          including the variables used in its derivation, should be indicated in the
          variable metadata for AVISIT. The values and the rules for deriving AVISIT
          may be different for different parameters within the same dataset. Values
          of AVISIT are producer-defined, and are often directly usable in Clinical
          Study Report displays.

        :name: AVISITN
        :notes: |-
          A numeric representation of AVISIT. Since study visits are usually defined by certain timepoints, defining AVISITN so that it represents the timepoint associated with the visit can facilitate plotting and interpretation of the values. Alternatively, AVISITN may be a protocol visit number, a cycle number, an analysis visit number, or any other number logically related to AVISIT or useful for sorting that is needed for analysis.

          Within a parameter, there is a one-to-one mapping between AVISITN and AVISIT so that AVISITN has the same value for each distinct AVISIT. (Best practice would dictate that the mapping would be one-to-one within a study, but that is not an ADaM requirement.) In the event that a record does not fall within any predefined analysis timepoint window, AVISITN can be populated in any way that the producer chooses to indicate this fact (e.g., may be null). Values of AVISITN are producer-defined.

          by nominal, assigned or analysis timepoint (instead of or in addition to
          by-visit). Timepoints are relative to ATPTREF. ATPT may contain the timepoint
          names as observed (i.e., from SDTM --TPT), derived timepoint names, time
          window names, conceptual descriptions (such as Average, Endpoint, etc.),
          or a combination of any of these. This variable is often used in conjunction
          with AVISIT. ATPT represents the analysis timepoint of the record. \nATPT
          can be within an analysis visit (e.g., blood pressure assessments at 10
          min, 20 min, and 30 min post-dose at AVISIT=Week 1) or can be unrelated
          to AVISIT (e.g., migraine symptoms 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min post-dose
          for attack 1).\n\nThe way that ATPT is calculated, including the variables
          used in its derivation, should be indicated in the variable metadata for
          ATPT. The values and the rules for deriving ATPT may be different for different
          parameters within the same dataset. Values of ATPT are producer-defined,
          and are often directly usable in Clinical Study Report displays."

          PARAM must include all descriptive and qualifying information relevant to
          the analysis purpose of the parameter.\n\nExamples of qualifying information
          that might be relevant to analysis and therefore are candidates for inclusion
          in PARAM are units, specimen type, location, position, machine type, and
          transformation function. There is no need to include qualifiers that are
          not relevant to the analysis of PARAM. In contrast to SDTM --TEST, no additional
          variable is needed to further qualify PARAM. \n\nPARAM may be longer than
          40 characters in length but is restricted to a maximum of 200 characters.
          PARAM is often directly usable in Clinical Study Report displays. Note that

          an existing record is being replaced with a value based on a pre-specified
          algorithm.\n\nDTYPE is used to denote analysis values that are “special
          cases” within a parameter. For each value of DTYPE, the precise derivation
          algorithm must be defined in analysis variable metadata, even for DTYPE
          values in the controlled terminology. The controlled terminology for DTYPE
          is extensible. See Section 4 for examples of the use of DTYPE.\n\nExamples
          of DTYPE values:\nLOCF = last observation carried forward.\nWOCF = worst

        :name: ANLzzFL
        :notes: "ANLzzFL is a conditionally required flag to be used in addition to
          other selection variables when the other selection variables in combination
          are insufficient to identify the exact set of records used for one or more
          analyses. Often one ANLzzFL will serve to support the accurate selection
          of records for more than one analysis. Note that it is allowable to add
          additional descriptive text to the label (see Section 3.1.6, Item 1). \n\nWhen
          one is defining the set of records used in a particular analysis or family
          of analyses, ANLzzFL is supplemental to, and is intended to be used in conjunction
          with, other selection variables, such as subject-level, parameter-level
          and record-level population flags, AVISIT, DTYPE, grouping variables such
          as SITEGRy, and others. The lower-case letter “zz” in the variable name
          is an index for the zzth record selection algorithm where “zz” is replaced
          with a zero-padded two-digit integer [01-99]. Every record selection algorithm
          “zz” (i.e., every algorithm for populating an ANLzzFL) must be defined in
          variable metadata. When the set of records that the algorithm “zz” operates
          on is pre-filtered by application of other criteria, such as a record-level
          population flag, then the selection algorithm definition in the metadata
          must so specify.\n\nNote that the ANLzzFL value of Y indicates that the
          record fulfilled the requirements of the algorithm, but does not necessarily
          imply that the record was actually used in one or more analyses, as whether
          or not a record is used also depends on the other selection variables applied.
          The ANLzzFL flag is useful in many circumstances; an example is when there
          is more than one record for an analysis timepoint within a subject and parameter,
          as it can be used to identify the record chosen to represent the timepoint
          for an analysis. “zz” is an index for a record selection algorithm, such
          as “record closest to target relative day for the AVISIT, with ties broken
          by the latest record, for each AVISIT within <list of AVISITS>.” \n\nNote
          that it is not required that a specific ANLzzFL variable has the same definition
          across a project or even across datasets within a study. There is also no
          requirement that the ANLzzFL variables in a dataset or study be used in
          numerical order; e.g. ANL02FL might occur in a dataset or study without
          ANL01FL present in the same dataset or study."
