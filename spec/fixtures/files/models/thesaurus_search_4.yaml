  notation: TEMP
  synonym: Temperature
  definition: 'The property of a body or region of space that determines whether or
    not there will be a net flow of heat into it or out of it from a neighboring body
    or region and in which direction (if any) the heat will flow, perceptible by living
    organism as a somatic sensation of cold or heat. It is a measure of the average
    translational kinetic energy associated with the disordered microscopic motion
    of atoms and molecules. Temperature is measured in one of the three standard temperature
    scales: Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit. (NCI)'
