  :notation: BASIC DATA STRUCTURE
  :synonym: BDS
  :definition: An ADaM BDS dataset contains one or more records per subject, per analysis
    parameter, per analysis time point. Variables include the value being analyzed
    (e.g., AVAL) and the description of the value being analyzed (e.g., PARAM). Other
    variables in the dataset provide more information about the value being analyzed
    (e.g., the subject identification) or describe and trace the derivation of it
    (e.g., DTYPE) or support the analysis of it (e.g., treatment variables, covariates).
