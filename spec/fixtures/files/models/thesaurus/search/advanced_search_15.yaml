  :definition: 'The property of a body or region of space that determines whether
    or not there will be a net flow of heat into it or out of it from a neighboring
    body or region and in which direction (if any) the heat will flow, perceptible
    by living organism as a somatic sensation of cold or heat. It is a measure of
    the average translational kinetic energy associated with the disordered microscopic
    motion of atoms and molecules. Temperature is measured in one of the three standard
    temperature scales: Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit. (NCI)'
