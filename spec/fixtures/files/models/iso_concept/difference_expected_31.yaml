      Code of actual Arm. When an Arm is not planned (not in Trial Arms), ACTARMCD will be UNPLAN. Randomized subjects who were not treated will be given a value of NOTTRT. Values should be "SCRNFAIL" for screen failures and "NOTASSGN" for subjects not assigned to treatment. Restricted to values in Trial Arms in all other cases.

      ACTARMCD is limited to 20 characters and does not have special character restrictions. The maximum length of ACTARMCD is longer than for other short variables to accommodate the kind of values that are likely to be needed for crossover trials.
