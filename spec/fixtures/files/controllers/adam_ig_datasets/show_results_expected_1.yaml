    does not have to map to VISIT from the SDTM. AVISIT represents the analysis visit
    of the record, but it does not mean that the record was analyzed. There are often
    multiple records for the same subject and parameter that have the same value of
    AVISIT. ANLzzFL and other variables may be needed to identify the records selected
    for any given analysis. See Section 3.2.6 for metadata about flag variables. AVISIT
    should be unique for a given analysis visit window. In the event that a record
    does not fall within any predefined analysis timepoint window, AVISIT can be populated
    in any way that the sponsor chooses to indicate this fact (i.e., blank or 'Not
    Windowed'). The way that AVISIT is calculated, including the variables used in
    its derivation, should be indicated in the variable metadata for AVISIT. The values
    and the rules for deriving AVISIT may be different for different parameters within
    the same dataset. Values of AVISIT are sponsor-defined, and are often directly
    usable in Clinical Study Report displays.

    used to denote that an analysis parameter is derived. PARAMTYP may be used to
    indicate that an entire parameter is derived. For each value of DTYPE, the precise
    derivation algorithm must be defined in analysis variable metadata, even for DTYPE
    values in the controlled terminology. See Section 4 for examples of the use of
    DTYPE. Examples of DTYPE values LOCF = last observation carried forward. WOCF
    = worst observation carried forward. AVERAGE = average of values.

  :ct_notes: Y
  :notes: ANLzzFL is a conditionally required flag to be used in addition to other
    selection variables when the other selection variables in combination are insufficient
    to identify the exact set of records used for one or more analyses. Often one
    ANLzzFL will serve to support the accurate selection of records for more than
    one analysis. When one is defining the set of records used in a particular analysis
    or family of analyses, ANLzzFL is supplemental to, and is intended to be used
    in conjunction with, other selection variables, such as subject-level, parameter-level
    and record-level population flags, AVISIT, DTYPE, grouping variables such as SITEGRy,
    and others. Every record selection algorithm 'zz' (i.e., every algorithm for populating
    an ANLzzFL) must be defined in variable metadata. When the set of records that
    the algorithm 'zz' operates on is pre-filtered by application of other criteria,
    such as a record-level population flag, then the selection algorithm definition
    in the metadata must so specify. Note that the ANLzzFL value of Y indicates that
    the record fulfilled the requirements of the algorithm, but does not necessarily
    imply that the record was actually used in one or more analyses, as whether or
    not a record is used also depends on the other selection variables applied. The
    ANLzzFL flag is useful in many circumstances; an example is when there is more
    than one record for an analysis timepoint within a subject and parameter, as it
    can be used to identify the record chosen to represent the timepoint for an analysis.
    'zz' is an index for a record selection algorithm, such as 'record closest to
    target relative day for the AVISIT, with ties broken by the latest record, for
    each AVISIT within <list of AVISITS>.'
